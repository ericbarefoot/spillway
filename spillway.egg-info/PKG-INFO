        # `spillway`
        Discharge and water surface profiles on spillways.
        
        `spillway.py` is module that contains the equations and solvers. `example.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook showing how to set up a model instance and use `spillway` objects.

        ## Installation
        
        ### Via pip and PyPI
        
        Releases will be sent to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), and also eventually published on conda-forge.
        
        To download and install the release version within your python system, use:
        
        ```
        # Python 2
        pip2 install spillway_eab # Python 2; deprecated :(
        
        # Python 3 (implicit, assuming your packages are updated)
        pip install spillway_eab
        
        # Python 3 (explicit)
        pip3 install spillway_eab
        ```
        
        ### Locally with pip and incorporating ongoing code modifications
        
        To install the unreleased code from this repository and/or to make changes to it locally and have this reflected immediately in how `spillway` runs:
        
        ```
        # Download the repository
        git clone https://github.com/ericbarefoot/spillway.git
        
        # Install it
        # First, navigate to the root spillway directory. Then do one or both of:
        pip2 install -e . # Python 2; deprecated :(
        pip install -e . # Python 3; recommended
        pip3 install -e . # Python 3; command to explicitly use this version
        ```
        
        Of course, you may always just download the `spillway` source from here and run it as a local (rather than system-wide installed) module. But this can be inconvenient when needing to manage the directory of `spillway.py` relative to that of the driver `*.py` file that you are building to create your model run.
        
        ## Learning how to use spillway
        
        ### Flow through a spillway with constant pool levels at either end.
        
        For a tutorial run the [Jupyter notebook contained within this package](https://github.com/ericbarefoot/spillway/example.ipynb). After installing Jupyter on your local machine, navigate to this directory in the terminal and type:
        ```
        jupyter notebook
        ```
        to launch it. Alternatively, a number of cloud-based services can host Jupyter notebooks.
